         <li><p class="para1">Our mission is to ensure that our Kenyan communities have a just environment without poverty. 
            Our aim is to ensure that our communities are valued and treated equally through enjoying their rights
            as full citizens, and can also influence decisions affecting their lives.
            Our main objective is also help create lasting solutions to the injustice of poverty.
            We therefore are a part of a global movement for change, empowering people to create a future that is secure, just, and free from poverty.</p></li>
         <li><p class="para2">Our Vision is to ensure that we unleash people's potential to create a positive change</p></li>
         <li><p class="para3">Our Purpose is to use a combination of rights-based sustainable development programs,
                public education, campaigns, advocacy, and humanitarian assistance in disasters and conflicts.We challenge the structural causes of the injustice of poverty,
                 and work with allies and partners locally and globally.</p></li>
         <li><p class="para4">Our beliefs are that Poverty is rooted in inequality, and in human action or inaction. 
             It can be worsened by natural disasters, human violence, oppression and environmental damage, and maintained by institutions and economic means.
             Therefore everyone has a right to realize their potential, and to live free of poverty in a secure and more equitable world. 
             We believe that with the necessary action and political will, this world is possible.
                We face unprecedented changes and challenges this century, including climate change, famines and food price crises, increasing humanitarian crises, energy limitations, proliferation of weapons, urbanization, and natural resources shortages. By working together, we will enhance our collective impact and cost effectiveness, and thus contribute to a just world without poverty.
