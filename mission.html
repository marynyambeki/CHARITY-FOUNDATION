            <h1><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h1>
            <p>We believe that Poverty is rooted in inequality, and in human action or inaction and therefore our mission is to ensure that our Kenyan communities have a just environment without poverty.</p>
            <p>This can be achieved by ensuring that they are valued and treated equally through enjoying their rights
            as full citizens, and can also influence decisions affecting their lives.</p>
            <p>Our main objective is to help create lasting solutions to the injustice of poverty.</p>
            <p>We also hope to unleash people's potential to create a positive change through the use of a combination of rights-based sustainable development programs,
                public education, campaigns, advocacy, and humanitarian assistance in disasters and conflicts.</p>
            <p>We challenge the structural causes of the injustice of poverty,</p>
                 and work with allies and partners locally and globally.</p>
