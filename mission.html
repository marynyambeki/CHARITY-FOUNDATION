     <p class="para1">Our mission is to ensure that our Kenyan communities have a just environment without poverty.
            Our aim is to ensure that our communities are valued and treated equally through enjoying their rights
            as full citizens, and can also influence decisions affecting their lives.
            Our main objective is also help create lasting solutions to the injustice of poverty.
            We therefore are a part of a global movement for change, empowering people to create a future that is secure, just, and free from poverty</p>
