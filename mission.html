            <h1><strong><font color="#B22222">OUR MISSION</font></strong></h1>
            <p>We believe that Poverty is rooted in inequality, and in human action or inaction and therefore our mission is to ensure that our Kenyan communities have a just environment without poverty.This can be achieved by ensuring that they are valued and treated equally through enjoying their rights
            as full citizens, and can also influence decisions affecting their lives.</p>
            <p>Our mission therefore  is to help create lasting solutions to the injustice of poverty and also hope to unleash people's potential to create a positive change through the use of a combination of rights-based sustainable development programs,
                public education, campaigns, advocacy, and humanitarian assistance in disasters and conflicts.</p>
